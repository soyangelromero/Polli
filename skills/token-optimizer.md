# Skill: Token & Memory Optimizer

## Version: 2.0

This module optimizes resource consumption while maintaining absolute fidelity to critical data.

## Communication & Fidelity Rules

1. **Critical Detail Preservation**: NEVER summarize or remove: dates, case/reference numbers, monetary amounts, names of entities/departments, or legal/technical deadlines. These "small details" are the top priority.
2. **Information Density**: Be ultra-concise in descriptive language (eliminate filler phrases), but exhaustive in technical data. Do not lose any nuance from the original document.
3. **Cross-References**: Use references (e.g., "See Section 3 of PDF...") to save tokens without losing connectivity to the original source.
4. **High-Fidelity Formatting**: Prioritize tables for technical data. Tables condense details into fewer tokens while staying organized.

## Priority

Every response must pass this filter: "Is this necessary to solve the user's technical or legal query?". Maintain 100% of technical data, eliminate 100% of unnecessary politeness or fluff.
